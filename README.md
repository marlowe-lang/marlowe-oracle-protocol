# Marlowe Oracle Protocol

In this repo we track the development and discussion around the oracle protocol:

<!--
* The CIP which is one of the side effects of this effort can be found in the [CIP XXX Marlowe Oracle Protocol.md](./CIP%20XXX%20Marlowe%20Oracle%20Protocol.md) file.
-->
  
* Some files and simple scripts are present here to ease the development process:

  * [markdown-watcher.sh](./markdown-watcher.sh) and [diagrams/dot-watcher.sh](./diagrams/dot-watcher.sh) are simple scripts to watch for changes in the markdown and dot files and generate the corresponding diagrams and open up a browser and pdfs.

  * [github-markdown.css](./github-markdown.css) is a CSS file to be used with the markdown-watcher.sh script to generate an html file which approximates the github markdown style. Please note that it is not a 100% exact rendering.
