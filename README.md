# Marlowe Oracle Protocol

In this repo we track the development and discussion around the oracle protocol:

* The CIP document versions which are the side effects of this effort can be found in the [./CIP XXX Marlowe Oracle Protocol](./CIP%20XXX%20Marlowe%20Oracle%20Protocol) directory.

## Development Flow

### Working on The CIP document

* The editing process of the latest CIP document version should happen on the `develop` branch.

* In order to have a live preview which approximates the github rendering of the markdown please enter CIP directory and run the following command in a separate shell:
  ```bash
  $ cd ./CIP\ XXX\ Marlowe\ Oracle\ Protocol
  $ ./markdown-watcher.sh
  ```
